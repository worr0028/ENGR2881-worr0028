## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can only be used to read from sockets.
ab=f
# Question 'ac': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language accepts all waiting network sockets each time it is called.
ac=f
# Question 'ad': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language creates a new socket for each received connection.
ad=t
# Question 'ae': True or false: The recv() function for the C programming language is less flexible than the recvfrom() function.
ae=t
# Question 'af': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language restricts the permissions of a network socket
af=f
# Question 'ag': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language normally requires the network address, but not any layer 4 address of the target.
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: Socket programming refers to programming using the network sockets software abstraction
ah=t
# Question 'ai': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language checks for newly received socket connections.
ai=t
# Question 'aj': True or false: The recv() function for the C programming language normally waits for data to arrive, if none is waiting.
aj=t
# Question 'ak': True or false: Socket programming refers to programming the sockets that accept network cables on network switches
ak=f
# Question 'al': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language normally requires the network address and layer 4 address of the target.
al=f
# Question 'am': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3, but not layer 4
am=f
# Question 'an': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language performs the same function as write(), but without the possibility to set flags.
an=t
# Question 'ao': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language specifies the maximum number of connections a server can receive before the socket must be re-opened.
ao=t
# Question 'ap': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language requires a network address, to be able to create a socket.
