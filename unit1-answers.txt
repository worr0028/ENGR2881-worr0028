## Name and describe five reliability challenges for computer networks, referring to the network layers at which these challenges either arise, or are solved.
# Question 'cv': Reliability Challenge #0
cv=Misconfiguration can be reduced by automation rather than manual entries. However, if misconfiguration does occur mechanisms such as error control, flow control and congestion control all occur in the transport layer and work to keep track of data packets, check for errors and duplication and resend information that fails delivery.
# Question 'cw': Reliability Challenge #1
cw=Security Breaches typically occur in the lower levels of the OSI model such as the data link layer but affects the uppers layers such as the transport later or presentation layer. To help prevent these attacks, configuration is run in the data link layer to ignore malicious ARPs.
# Question 'cx': Reliability Challenge #2
cx=Poor / Outdated Equipment refer to any obsolete, compromised or redundant device can be a potential threat to the network itâ€™s connected to. Equipment at layer 1 of the OSI model such as cables, computers or servers may need replacing for a network to perform as reliable as possible.
# Question 'cy': Reliability Challenge #3
cy=Human Error can occur on the physical or application layer. This may include an incorrect setup of hardware or the misuse of software. By keeping users informed and up-to-date with a system, human errors are minimised and if one does occur it is easier to resolve.
# Question 'cz': Reliability Challenge #4
cz=Incompatible Changes occur when a change you intend to make does not work as intended alongside other equipment or software. It is important to test equipment and software prior to initialising it in the network. This can affect every layer of the OSI model in a network including a new interface that would affect the application layer or even a new device that would occur in the physical layer but may affect any layer above it.
# Question 'da': Congestion and packet loss 
BEGIN:da
Congestion in a computer network is the reduced quality of service that typically occurs when a network node is carrying more data than it can handle. This can lead to queuing delay, the blocking of new connections, or even packet loss. A consequence of this congestion is the decrease of network throughput. Packet loss refers to the loss of packets of information that are sent over a network after the Transmission Control Protocol breaks a file down into a send able state. The Transmission Control Protocol uses algorithms such as the 'slow start' mechanism, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit and fast recovery. These techniques are referred to as 'TCP Reno' and all play to reduce congestion and thus packet loss. However, in doing so, if packet loss has occurred due to transmission errors, a long latency or sudden delays on the wireless link and has nothing to do with congestion, the TCP may get confused and try to throughput more data than the available line rate can manage. To avoid this it is important to optimise a TCP on a wireless network as often as possible.
END:da
# Question 'db': In which layer is security normally implemented in the OSI layered network model? Choose two other layers, and suggest how security might be implemented in each of those layers instead. 
BEGIN:db
Security is usually implemented in the Application Layer. This is because attacks such as worms or viruses are used and are usually given access to a network through human error. This is not the only layer that is at threat or in need or protecting. The Data Link and Network layers are two other layers that my fall under attack during a security breach. The data link layer can be attacked through ARPspoofing, MAC flooding and a spamming tree attack. The network layer however, may have difficulties with unauthorised access, endpoint identity theft and SYN flood. To minimise these risks it is important to install Private VLANs, Static ARP Entries, STP Root Priority =0 in the data link layer and to employ VPN's, Network Based Intrusion Detection, Content Filtering in the network layer.
