# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'symmetric encryption'
BEGIN:ab
Encryption refers to the process of encoding information. It changes plaintext to ciphertext with the intent of securing the privacy of the data from malicious third parties. A ‘key’ is used to encrypt and decipher the data on the sender and receiver ends. Symmetric Encryption is a type of encryption where only one key is used by both the sender and receiver. This differs from its counterpart Asymmetric Encryption in which two separate keys are used to encrypt and decipher the data. These keys can be in the form of a string of characters or numbers or could be created through a random number generator. There are two types of symmetric encryption, block algorithms and stream algorithms. A block algorithm is when bits are encrypted into blocks of data using a key and the receiving system retains this data in its memory while waiting for complete blocks to be obtained. A stream algorithm refers to data being encrypted as it streams rather than be stored in a systems memory. Symmetric encryption is used on many different applications. This includes payment applications, identity validation applications and most importantly banking. Banks must use symmetric encryption keys that not only are random generated numbers but are in accordance with the industry standards such as ‘FIPS 140-2’.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'certificate authorities'
BEGIN:ac
Certificate authorities are companies or businesses which specialise in validating the authenticity of entities. This includes websites, email addresses, businesses and even people. Once an entity has been successfully validated, they then bind to a cryptographic key using an electronic digital certificate. This digital certificate provides authentication, encryption and integrity of the entity. It will also create a public key and a private key as well as a certificate signing request (CSR). The CSR is where the public key is stored as well as other information about the entity. This is usually performed on the server where the certificate will be installed and has different information depending on what type of entity it is being generated for. The private key, however, is solely for the applicant and should not be revealed in a certificate authority or anyone who may have malicious intent. Furthermore, after a CSR is generated, it is sent to a certificate authority who verifies its legitimacy and sends it to the applicant along with a private key. Once the recipient has received the signed certificate, they can confirm the certificates authorities’ digital signature via the public key. The recipient is also able to compare the private key against the sender to assure the certificate has not been altered since being signed by the certificate authority.
